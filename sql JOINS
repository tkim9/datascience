# AS Statement

EX. Returns payment_id column with new column name 'my_payment_column'
SELECT payment_id AS my_payment_column
FROM payment;

EX.
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment
GROUP BY (customer_id);

Note that there is no '' so it is like writing existing columns


# JOINS Overview
- useful link: https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/
- used to join tables
- inner join syntax, pka: primary key for a table
- you can use JOIN instead of INNER JOIN

SELECT A.pka, A.c1, B.pkb, B.c2
FROM A                                       
INNER JOIN B ON A.pka = B.fka
-> A is the primary table and is addion on table B

EX.
SELECT customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, amount, payment_date     # amount is in payment table but sql will know.
FROM customer
INNER JOIN payment ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
ORDER BY customer.customer_id;

EX. shows how many copies of each title is at store1
SELECT title, COUNT(title) AS copies_at_store1
FROM inventory
INNER JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE store_id = 1
GROUP BY title;

EX. use of AS Statement on inner join
SELECT title, language.name AS movie_language
FROM film
INNER JOIN language AS lan ON film.language_id = lan.language_id;


# Outer Join
-FULL OUTER JOIN
get everything of tableA or tableB regardless of they are matching or not
-Syntax
SELECT * 
FROM tableA
FULL OUTER JOIN tableB ON TableA.name = TableB.name

-LEFT OUTER JOIN
you will get everything for tableA but get only matchings on tableB
so no null value on tableB.
-syntax
SELECT * 
FROM tableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN tableB ON TableA.name = TableB.name

-Left OUTER JOIN with WHERE 
used to get only A - A&B, so exclusively A
-syntax
SELECT * 
FROM tableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN tableB ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableB.id IS null

EX.
SELECT film.film_id, film.title, inventory_id
FROM film
LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id 
WHERE inventory.film_id is NULL;

-FULL OUTER JOIN with WHERE
AUB - A&B
-syntax
SELECT * 
FROM tableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN tableB ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableB.id IS null OR TableA.id IS null

* LEFT OUTER JOIN can be simply written as LEFT JOIN


# UNION Statement
it will combine two tables but delete duplicate row (meaning every single column in that row is same)
-syntax
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM tbl_name_1
UNION
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM tbl_name_2;

-requirements
Both queries must return the same number of columns
The corresponding columns in the queries must have compatible data types
